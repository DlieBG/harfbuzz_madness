# harfbuzz_madness

When I saw the llama.ttf project of fuglede, I wanted to try something similar.\
So I build an inference engine with Rust and WASM for HarfBuzz that generates a font that is able to change the characters of a text under some specific conditions.

I also wanted to understand how easy/hard it is to compile and use such a inference engine on your devices.\
I think this is a feature that can possibly be used in an unconventional way with an impact on security...
